🌟 CODSOFT Java Programming Internship 🚀
Welcome to my Java Programming Internship repository! This repository showcases the tasks I completed during my internship at CODSOFT. Each task demonstrates different aspects of Java programming, ranging from simple games to practical applications. Let's dive into the details! 🎉

📂 Repository Structure
This repository contains the following tasks:

TASK1.java - 🧮 Number Game
TASK2.java - 🎓 Student Grade Calculator
TASK3.java - 🏧 ATM Interface
📝 Task Descriptions
1. 🧮 Number Game (TASK1.java)
The Number Game is a simple Java program where the user guesses a number generated by the system. This task tests logical thinking and implements the following concepts:

Random number generation.
User input handling.
Conditional statements for feedback (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
📌 Features:

Set range for guessing numbers.
Keep track of attempts.
Provide feedback after each guess.
2. 🎓 Student Grade Calculator (TASK2.java)
The Student Grade Calculator is a practical program that calculates and assigns grades based on students' scores. This task demonstrates:

Input validation.
Calculation logic.
Decision-making using if-else or switch-case structures.
📌 Features:

Accepts multiple students' marks.
Calculates total, average, and grade.
Displays results in a formatted manner.
3. 🏧 ATM Interface (TASK3.java)
The ATM Interface simulates basic ATM functionalities. It is an interactive console-based program that includes:

Account balance inquiry.
Cash withdrawal and deposit options.
Exit functionality.
📌 Features:

User authentication (PIN-based login).
Real-time balance updates.
Error handling for invalid inputs or insufficient balance.
