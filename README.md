## 📝 Task Descriptions

### 1. 🧮 Number Game (TASK1.java)
The **Number Game** is a simple Java program where the user guesses a number generated by the system. This task tests logical thinking and implements the following concepts:
- **Random number generation**
- **User input handling**
- **Conditional statements** for feedback (e.g., "too high" or "too low")

📌 **Features:**
- Allows the user to guess numbers within a predefined range.
- Keeps track of the number of attempts.
- Provides feedback after each guess.

### 2. 🎓 Student Grade Calculator (TASK2.java)
The **Student Grade Calculator** is a practical program that calculates and assigns grades based on students' scores. This task demonstrates:
- **Input validation**
- **Grade calculation logic**
- **Decision-making** using if-else or switch-case structures

📌 **Features:**
- Accepts marks for multiple students.
- Calculates total marks, average, and grade.
- Displays results in a clean, formatted output.

### 3. 🏧 ATM Interface (TASK3.java)
The **ATM Interface** simulates basic ATM functionalities. It is an interactive console-based program that includes:
- **Account balance inquiry**
- **Cash withdrawal and deposit options**
- **Exit functionality**

📌 **Features:**
- User authentication using a PIN-based login.
- Real-time balance updates after transactions.
- Error handling for invalid inputs or insufficient balance.
